# WikiBot AI Assistant

## Overview
Welcome to WikiBot AI Assistant! This application is designed to handle Wikipedia summary queries and engage in light conversations using the DialogPT-small model. As this is my first project, please note that it may contain errors or incomplete features. I appreciate your understanding as I continue to improve it!

## Usage
Feel free to test the bot with the following example queries:

### Wikipedia Summary Queries:
- India
- United States
- World War

These queries will prompt the bot to retrieve relevant summaries from Wikipedia.

### DialogPT Conversations:
- Hi
- Hello
- How are you?
- I love you.

Note: Please limit conversations to simple queries, as the DialogPT-small model may not produce coherent outputs for more complex inputs.
